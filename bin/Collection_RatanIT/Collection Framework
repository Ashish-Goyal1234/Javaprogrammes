Collection Framework:
-----------------------

1. Introduced in 1.2 version but Collection are popular from 1.5 version because of autoboxing and generics.

Defn:
1. Collection Framework is used to represent group of objects as single entity.
2. Collection Framework provides to store the data and manipulate the data.
3. Collection framework is having group classes and interfaces to work with group of objects.


----------Collection framework belongs to package java.util.--------

Collection framework divided into 2 parts:
--------------------------------------------
1. Collection: Collection divided into 3 parts:
	1.1 List Classes.
	1.2 Set classes.
	1.3 Queue Classes.

2. Map: 

Below are main topics For collection:
-------------------------------------------
1. Collection data.
2. Map Data.
3. Cursors: To read the data from collection classes.
4. Collection sorting.
5. Collection with stream API.


Arrays Vs Collections:
-------------------------
1. Arrays can store homogeneus(Accepts same type of data) data and 
	collectins can store hetrogenius(Accepts different type of data) data.
2. Arrays can store primitive and object data collections can store only object data never encourage primitive data.
3. Arrays size is fixed collection size automatically increase and decrease.
4. Arrays do not support methods but collection supports methods.
5. Arrays performance is good as compare to collection.

The root interface of collections is collection.
The root interface of Map is Map.
The parent interface of the collection is iterable.

Key interfaces of collection framework:
---------------------------------------------
1. Collections.
2. List.
3. Set
	3.1 Sorted set.
	3.2 Navigable set.
4. Queue.


Map data Key Interface:
----------------------------
1. Map
	1.1 Sorted map.
	1.2 Navigable Map.
	
	
Cursor key Interface:
------------------------------	
1. Cursors:
	1.1 Enumeration.
	1.2 Iterator.
	1.3 ListIterator.
	
	
Sorting key interface:
---------------------------------	
1. Sorting:
 	1.1 comparable.
 	1.2 comparator.
 	
 	
 Start Laerning Collection:
=================================
 1. List Interface:
 	Parent class for list interface is collection, and parent class for collection is Iterable.
 	
2. List Interface contain some classes:
	1. Array List.
	2. Linked List.
	3. Vector.
		3.1 Stack.
