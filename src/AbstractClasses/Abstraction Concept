There are two types of classes normal class and abstract class:
Normal classes are also known as concrete classes.

Normal method:
--------------
		void m1(){     // Method declaration
		
			m1();     // Method Implementation.
		
		}
		
Abstract Classes:
------------------
 
 Abstract void m1();    //Contains only method declaration.
 
 * If a Class contain atleast one abstract method, then the class is called as abstract class.To
 	represent class as abstract we declare Abstract in front of class.
 	E.g: Abstract class test() {
 	
 		Abstract void m1();
 	}
 	
 	
* Abstract class may contain abstract method or may not contain abstract method, but for abstract
  classes object creation is not possible.
  E.g: Abstract class test() {
  
  		void m1();
  		void m2();			// methods are not abstract still class is abstract because of abstract keyword.
  		void m3();
  }
  
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Parent class can hold object fo child class object.
	  E.g : Parent p = new child();   // Allowed.
	  
  2. Abstract method can have any return type and number of arguments.
  3. Abstract method can be overloaded.
  4. Inside Abstract class main method is possible but object creation is not possible.
  5. Inside Abstract class constructor declaration is possible.
  6. Inside abstract class:
  		Variables possible.
  		methods possible.
  		constructor possible.
  		instance block possible.
  		static block possible.
  		
  		
 Difference between Abstract class and Interface:
 ======================================================
1. Abstract class can have non abstract method  also but in interface all the methods are by default abstract.
2.  To implement abstract class methods you have to extends abstract class in child class but in interface you have to implements.
3. Contractor declaration in abstract class is possible but that is not supported in interface.
4. You can extends only one abstract class in child class but you  can implements more than one  interface in implementing class.


Interview Questions:
=====================
1. Abstract classes May contain or may not contain abstract methods but abstract classes not able to create object creation.
2. abstract class test {
	public final abstract void m1(); // This is illegal combination as in abstract class we need to override methods in child class.
   }
	
3. abstract class test { 
	static abstract void m1(); // This is illegal combination as in abstract class we need to override methods in child class.
   }
   
4. abstract class test { 
	private abstract void m1(); // This is illegal combination as in abstract class we need to override methods in child class.
   }
