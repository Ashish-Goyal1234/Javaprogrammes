* Interface is used to declare functionality of the project but abstract class is a place where you declare normal method as well as 
abstract method.

E.g:
----
Interface it1 {   // By default interface is abstract and object is not possible in interfaces.

	void m1(); // by default interface methods are public and abstract no need to declare abstract keyword like abstract method.
}

* Compiler will generate .class for Interface.
