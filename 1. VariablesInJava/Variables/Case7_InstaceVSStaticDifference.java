                 e2 obj 2= 2002   pqrs  TCS
                 e3 obj 3 = 3003  xyz   TCS
                 
                 here in the above example for all 3 objects we have one common value "TCS", no need to create seprate memory for all the objects,
                 common copy is enough.
                 So to declare common memeory we declare static.

                               emp id;
                               emp name;
                   static    emp company;  // Hold common memory TCS and memory will be saved.
                 }
